    <h2>Introduction to Tiranga Pride</h2>
    <p>
        The Tiranga, the National Flag of India, is more than just a tricolor banner. It is the living symbol of India’s sovereignty, dignity, unity and democratic spirit. Every time the Tiranga rises high in the sky, it fills millions of hearts with pride and emotion. It represents the sacrifices made by countless freedom fighters who dedicated their lives to achieving independence for the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tiranga Pride is about respecting the flag not only during national festivals but every single day. It reminds us of our duties as responsible citizens and encourages us to contribute positively to the nation’s growth and development.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Indian National Flag was officially adopted on 22 July 1947. Since then, it has become the most powerful symbol of India’s identity across the world.
    </p>

    <h2>Historical Significance of the Tiranga</h2>
    <p>
        The journey of the Indian National Flag reflects the journey of India’s freedom movement. Before independence, several versions of the flag were designed to represent unity among Indians fighting against colonial rule. Finally, the present form of the Tiranga was accepted by the Constituent Assembly shortly before independence.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Tiranga witnessed historic events such as the midnight of 15 August 1947, when India became independent. It has flown proudly during wars, peace missions, Olympic victories, scientific breakthroughs, and global diplomatic achievements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every major milestone in India’s development story carries the spirit of the Tiranga. From space missions to international conferences, the flag symbolizes the country’s progress and global recognition.

    <h2>Meaning Behind the Three Colors</h2>
    <p>
        The beauty of the Tiranga lies not only in its design but also in its deep meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Saffron (Kesari):</strong> The top band represents courage, strength, and sacrifice. It inspires leaders and citizens to remain fearless and selfless in serving the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>White:</strong> The middle band stands for peace, truth, and transparency. It reminds the country to walk on the path of honesty and harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Green:</strong> The bottom band symbolizes growth, prosperity, and faith. It reflects India’s agricultural richness and its continuous development.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Ashoka Chakra:</strong> The navy-blue wheel at the center has 24 spokes, symbolizing law, motion, and righteousness. It signifies that life should always move forward with justice and moral values.
    </p>

    <h2>The Tiranga in Modern India</h2>
    <p>
        In modern India, the Tiranga continues to inspire generations. During Independence Day and Republic Day celebrations, citizens proudly hoist the flag in schools, offices, homes, and public places. The flag brings people together regardless of religion, language, caste, or region.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Tiranga also represents India’s achievements on the global stage. Whenever Indian athletes win medals, scientists launch satellites, or leaders participate in international summits, the flag symbolizes the country’s strength and determination.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond celebrations, Tiranga Pride means living by the values it represents — courage, unity, discipline, and dedication. It is about respecting national integrity and contributing to society in meaningful ways.
    </p>

    <h2>Responsibility Towards the National Flag</h2>
    <p>
        Respecting the Tiranga is a duty of every Indian citizen. The flag should always be treated with honor and dignity. It must never touch the ground or be used inappropriately. Following proper flag code guidelines ensures that its respect is maintained at all times.
    </p>
    <p>
        True Tiranga Pride lies not only in waving the flag but also in living by the principles of unity, peace, and patriotism every day. It is about building a stronger, cleaner, and more progressive India.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Tiranga reminds us that despite our differences, we share one identity — we are Indians. It unites us under one nation, one constitution, and one shared future.
