<h2>About Tiranga Pride</h2>
<p>
Tiranga Pride represents the emotional connection, unity, and strength that every Indian feels towards the national identity. The word “Tiranga” symbolizes the three colors that define the Indian national flag, while “Pride” reflects the deep respect and honor associated with it. Tiranga Pride is not just a name — it is a feeling that binds millions of hearts together.
</p>
<p>
Across generations, the Tiranga has inspired people to stand strong during difficult times, celebrate achievements, and unite beyond differences of caste, religion, language, or region. Tiranga Pride stands for courage, unity, dignity, sacrifice, and national integrity. It reminds citizens of their responsibilities as well as their rights.
</p>
<p>
This platform celebrates that pride through knowledge, awareness, and appreciation of the values that the Tiranga represents. It promotes patriotism in a respectful and informative way while preserving historical importance and cultural depth.

<section id="history">
<h2>History of Tiranga</h2>
<p>
The journey of the Tiranga is deeply connected with India’s struggle for independence. Over the years, several versions of the flag were proposed before the final design was adopted. Freedom fighters and national leaders worked towards creating a symbol that would represent unity and independence.
</p>
<p>
The final design was officially adopted on 22 July 1947, shortly before India gained independence. It became a powerful emblem of freedom, self-respect, and sovereignty. Since then, it has flown proudly across the nation — from schools and government buildings to international platforms and global events.
</p>
<p>
The history of the Tiranga reflects sacrifice, resilience, and the determination of millions who fought for independence. Every fold of the flag carries stories of bravery and dedication that shaped the modern nation.

<h2>Meaning Behind Tiranga</h2>
<p>
Each element of the Tiranga carries powerful symbolism. The three colors represent values that guide the nation forward. Together they express harmony, strength, and progress.
</p>
<p>
The flag represents courage in the face of challenges, peace among diversity, and growth through unity. It is a reminder that development must be balanced with responsibility and justice. The circular wheel at the center signifies motion and progress — a nation that keeps moving forward.
</p>
<p>
Tiranga Pride celebrates these meanings and encourages every citizen to understand the deeper values embedded in the national symbol. It is not just about colors — it is about principles.
